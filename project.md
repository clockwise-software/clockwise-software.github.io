The final project will be the development of a system for identifying employees based upon their project areas. At the end, the final product will be a product that allows for matching people with specific skills to matching proposal requirements.


## Background 

Trihydro Corporation (Trihydro) is an engineering and environmental consulting firm based out of Laramie, Wyoming.  Trihydro has nearly 475 employees across the United States.  We offer a wide range of services including air quality and process management; engineering and surveying; environmental; health and safety; information technology; and water resources. 

## Problem 
Over the last 5 years, we have completed an average of 850 proposals per year.  Proposal amounts range from $1,000 to over a million dollars.  A couple questions that continuously arise during the proposal effort is “Who has project experience that live near the project location?” and “Who has relevant experience related to this proposal?”  To answer those questions, a company-wide e-mail is sent requesting expertise in the line of work and project area.  Employees can call the marketing team to determine relevant project experience, rely on other staff to respond (e.g., long-term employees), or maintain their own Excel file containing a list of staff and their areas of expertise.   

## Goal 

Trihydro desires a system of identifying employees, within the project area, that possess skills matching proposal requirements.
