## Day 1

### Team Contract
Cardiff University has some wonderful materials on [team contracts](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3izv0i4a901fn03/CM6223%20-%201%20-%20Daily%20Diary%20-%20CUESIP%20Guidelines.pdf?dl=0), and a [base code of conduct](https://www.dropbox.com/s/idm0y1f0qysjcrr/CM6223%20-%201%20-%20Daily%20Diary%20-%20CUESIP%20Code%20Of%20Conduct.pdf?dl=0) .

Create a team contract within your github wiki (contract, create a home as well?)

Your team contract should contain the following:

| Topic | Details |
| --- | --- |
|  Team Goals | What are the main goals of your team? | 
|Team Objectives| What specific actions or criteria relate to these goals? How can these be measured or evaluated? |
| Team Member Roles | What are the primary roles and responsibilities of each team member? |
| Team Norms | What operating rules does the team need? | 
|Team Member Evaluation| What criteria will be used to evaluate each member's performance?|

Another item to consider: team member constraints (how much time can team members contribute), skills, and expectations.

### Infrastructure

Our development environment is built on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io).

You should create a branch of your team's project ([cobalt](https://github.com/clockwise-software/cobalt), [copper](https://github.com/clockwise-software/copper), [zinc](https://github.com/clockwise-software/zinc), [platinum](https://github.com/clockwise-software/platinum)) called `yourlastname-gitpod-exploration`

Familiarize yourself with the gitpod environment.
In your open branch, launch gitpod 
 - use Chrome or Firefox for ease of use; [browser extensions](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/)
 - or http://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/clockwise-software/{teamname}/tree/{yourlastname-gitpod-exploration}
 - Watch a [few videos?](https://www.gitpod.io/screencasts/) 
 
Don't have access to GitPod? Ask your near-peer mentor! 

### Client Meeting Prep

Look over the [Industry need/challenge](https://github.com/clockwise-software/base-environment#industry-challenge) and brainstorm in your group what you can do and how you can extend this base environment. What question do you have for the client? 

### Planning
You should create / plan tasks using the github project area (e.g.,https://github.com/clockwise-software/{teamname}/projects/)
