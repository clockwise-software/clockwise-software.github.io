## Day 2

### Team Sync ~30 minutes
1. Take at least 15 minutes to regroup - given the objective of presenting a demo at ~2 PM:
 - what did you get done?, 
 - what are the open tasks?, 
 - what can you get done?
 - create and assignt tasks in github

2. Discuss as a group your top ~2-3 challenges this week. Find at least one technical challenge that you overcame and post the challenge and solution in the appropriate slack support channel!

### Work time
1. Work on your development tasks
2. Work on your presentation (see client meeting prep below)

### Client Meeting Prep
1. Copy this [presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X3q6Vz33gmd0TAQumtm8P6EbhMSSq4pl0P1Cc29uqO8/edit?usp=sharing) which uses the [costar method](https://ttwgorg.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ttwg-presentation-on-value-creation-methods-at-inl-costar-riis-29-may-2019-reduced.pdf)
2. Decide how, as a team, you will create, share, and/or edit your presentation document and **10 Minute presentation** 
3. Based on prior sharing issues, figure out who in your team can do a share screen (if there are issues, reach out to a host to elevate your permissions and test sharing BEFORE the meeting)
4. Add the presentation a) as a link to you're github markdown; 2) as a PDF in a new document folder in your repository
5. Do a dry-run of your presentation before you're time slot - see [schedule](schedule/)

### Post Client Meeting
1. Discuss what you heard/feedback
2. Regroup and plan your tasks for next week
3. Rescope as needed


## Day 1

### Team Contract
Cardiff University has some wonderful materials on [team contracts](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3izv0i4a901fn03/CM6223%20-%201%20-%20Daily%20Diary%20-%20CUESIP%20Guidelines.pdf?dl=0), and a [base code of conduct](https://www.dropbox.com/s/idm0y1f0qysjcrr/CM6223%20-%201%20-%20Daily%20Diary%20-%20CUESIP%20Code%20Of%20Conduct.pdf?dl=0). Successful partnerships are tricky, and they take time to develop, you can look at this [rubric](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tumvs0caa6wktow/Partnerhsip_Model_Mullinix_2001.pdf?dl=0) from Mullinix et al. which captures the partnership development continuum. 

Create a team contract within your github wiki (contract, create a home as well?)

Your team contract should contain the following:


 - Team Goals: What are the main goals of your team? 
 - Team Objectives: What specific actions or criteria relate to these goals? How can these be measured or evaluated? 
 - Team Member Roles: What are the primary roles and responsibilities of each team member?
 - Team Norm: What operating rules does the team need? 
 - Team Member Evaluation: What criteria will be used to evaluate each member's performance?

Another item to consider: team member constraints (how much time can team members contribute), skills, and expectations.

### Infrastructure

Our development environment is built on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io).

You should create a branch of your team's project ([cobalt](https://github.com/clockwise-software/cobalt), [copper](https://github.com/clockwise-software/copper), [zinc](https://github.com/clockwise-software/zinc), [platinum](https://github.com/clockwise-software/platinum)) called `yourlastname-gitpod-exploration`

Familiarize yourself with the gitpod environment.
In your open branch, launch gitpod 
 - use Chrome or Firefox for ease of use; [browser extensions](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/)
 - or http://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/clockwise-software/{teamname}/tree/{yourlastname-gitpod-exploration}
 - Watch a [few videos?](https://www.gitpod.io/screencasts/) 
 
Don't have access to GitPod? Ask your near-peer mentor! 

### Client Meeting Prep

Look over the [Industry need/challenge](https://github.com/clockwise-software/base-environment#industry-challenge), rewatch the video for Trihydro context and brainstorm in your group what you can do and how you can extend this base environment. What question do you have for the client?

### Planning
You should create / plan tasks using the github project area (e.g.,https://github.com/clockwise-software/{teamname}/projects/)
